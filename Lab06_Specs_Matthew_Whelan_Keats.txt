1. Player, as per the template, can move left & right and up & down
2. Player is animated as in the template. To show I know how to use the cel animation sequences, the coins(cats) are also animated.
3. There are platforms that are visible in the air. The colliders are not visible. The platforms can be landed on and collided with on all sides.
4. There are exactly 6 platforms in the game.
5. I'm not sure what qualifies as a beginning, but the player must collect the trophy, and there is an end screen.
6. There is a new class called coins. The player needs to collect 2 to finish the game.
7. The collider class is the parent of TopCollider, BottomCollider, RightCollider, and LeftCollider
